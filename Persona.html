      <h2>Persona 3 — <em>Memento Mori</em></h2>

      <p>Persona 3 embodies the theme of mortality, encapsulated in its central motif of memento mori—“remember that you will die.”
         The narrative confronts players with the inevitability of death, not as an abstract idea but as a tangible presence in the characters’ lives. 
         The “Dark Hour,” a hidden time between days, symbolizes the psychological space where humanity’s fears and suppressed truths manifest. 
         Shadows represent repressed aspects of the psyche, while the protagonist’s Persona, Thanatos, recalls death’s presence in both myth and psychology.
         Drawing from existential thought and the inevitability of mortality, the game reflects concerns explored by 
         philosophers such as <a href="Sources.html#ethics"><cite>Hannah Arendt</cite></a>, who emphasized human fragility and
         action in the face of death. The calendar system reinforces the finite nature of time, urging players to reflect on how 
         limited opportunities shape meaning in life. Ultimately, Persona 3 poses the question: how does one live authentically in the shadow of mortality?</p>

      <h2>Persona 4 — <em>Seek the Truth</em></h2>
      <p>While Persona 3 focuses on mortality, Persona 4 shifts attention to identity and truth. Set in the rural town of Inaba,
         the game explores the concept of the Shadow—the hidden and often denied aspects of the self. Characters are forced to confront
         distorted projections of themselves in the “TV World,” a symbolic unconscious realm. These confrontations dramatize the process of 
         individuation, the psychological journey of integrating one’s hidden traits into a unified self. This theme strongly echoes 
         <a href="Sources.html#jung"><cite>C. G. Jung</cite></a>’s ideas of the Shadow and individuation, where embracing one’s darker 
         aspects is necessary for wholeness. The narrative emphasizes the pursuit of truth, not only in solving the central murder mystery 
         but also in learning to accept the complexity of human nature. Friendships and bonds play a crucial role, demonstrating that self-realization 
         is not an isolated act but one deeply embedded in community and relationships. Persona 4 asks: can we accept both the light and dark within ourselves 
         and others to forge genuine connections?</p>

          <p><em>"Life without a connection to people is miserable."</em></p>

      <h2>Persona 5 — <em>Society & Justice</em></h2>
      <img src="images\5de2f42aa1d0450146bcbf74a815dc75.png" alt="Persona 5" loading="lazy" />
      <img src="images\persona-5-cast.avif" alt="Persona 5" loading="lazy" />
      <p>Persona 5 turns outward, addressing structures of power, injustice, and moral agency within society. The Phantom Thieves of Hearts operate 
        within a corrupt social system, rebelling against exploitation and abuse of authority. Here, the “Palaces” function as symbolic spaces of 
        distorted desires, where perpetrators’ inner corruption manifests as extravagant worlds of domination and greed. By “stealing hearts,” the 
        protagonists challenge entrenched systems of oppression, sparking questions about freedom, justice, and the legitimacy of rebellion. This 
        theme resonates with <a href="Sources.html#ethics"><cite>Aristotle</cite></a>, whose virtue ethics emphasized moral responsibility, and with 
        <a href="Sources.html#ethics"><cite>Hannah Arendt</cite></a>, who examined power, action, and the structures that govern society. The game 
        critiques complacency and conformity, urging players to consider how individuals can resist systemic injustice without losing their own moral 
        compass. Beneath its stylish veneer, Persona 5 is a meditation on autonomy, accountability, and the ethical complexities of revolutionary change.</p>
